# Workshop 1 - Introduction to BlueBEAR and Linux

Welcome to the first workshop of the MRICN course!

In this workshop we will introduce you to the environment where will run all of our analyses: the BlueBEAR Portal. Whilst you can run neuroimaging analyses on your own device, the various software and high computing resources needed necessitates a specifically-curated environment. At the CHBH we use BlueBEAR, which satisfies both of these needs. You will also be introduced to the Linux operating system (OS), which is the OS supported on the BlueBEAR Portal through Ubuntu. 
Linux OS is similar to other operating systems such as Mac OS and Windows, and can similarly be navigated by using terminal commands. Learning how to do so is key when working with data on Linux, and - as you will see in future workshops - is particularly useful when creating and running scripts for more complex data analyses.
