# Workshop 7 - Higher-level fMRI analysis

Welcome to the seventh workshop of the MRICN course! 

Prior lectures introduced you to the basic concepts and theory behind higher-level fMRI analysis, including multi-session analysis and the general linear model (GLM). <b>In this workshop you will be learning practical skills in how to run higher level fMRI analysis using FSL tools.</b>

This workshop follows on from the [workshop on first-level fMRI analysis](https://chbh-opensource.github.io/mri-on-bear-edu/workshop5/workshop5-intro/). In that workshop you analysed the first level data for 2 participants and at the end of the workshop you were asked to analyse the rest of the scans in the data set. Participants 1-2 had one fMRI experiment run each, participants 3-4 and 6-15 had 2 runs each and participant 5 had 3 runs, so there are a total of 29 runs from the 15 participants.

<b>We will now combine the fMRI data across runs and participants in our second and third-level analyses.</b>

!!! success "Overview of Workshop 6"
    Topics for this workshop include:

    - Combining scans when one participant has been scanned multiple-times (e.g., twice) within the same experiment
    - Combining scans across participants
    - Setting up different higher-level (second and third-level) fMRI analyses

As in the other workshops we will not discuss in detail why you might choose certain parameters. The aim of this workshop is to familiarise you with some of the available analysis tools. 
You are encouraged to read the pop-up help throughout (hold your mouse arrow over FSL GUI buttons and menus when setting your FEAT design), refer to your lecture notes lectures or resource list readings.

!!! note "More information"
    As always, you can also find more information on running higher-level fMRI analyses on the [FSL website](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/).
