# Gaining access to BlueBEAR and the BEAR Portal

Before you start with any workshop materials you will need to familiarise yourself with CHBH’s computational resources (BlueBEAR), The following pages are aimed at helping you to get started. 

Please carefully read the information as to put these workshop materials into practical use you will be expected to understand what BlueBEAR is, what it is used for and to make sure you have access (see below Pre-workshop Materials). In the Workshop 1 we will dive into using BEAR Portal and using Linux commands (see below Workshop 1 materials).

!!! note "For students"
    If you are an MSc student taking the MRICN module, please note that while there will be help available during all in person workshops in case you have any problems with using BEAR Portal, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have access, and you are familiar with information provided in pre-workshop materials. Failing to gain an understanding of BlueBEAR and using BEAR Portal will prevent you from participating in MRICN brain imaging practical sessions and completing module’s main assessment (data analysis). 

## What is BEAR and BlueBEAR?

BEAR stands for Birmingham Environment for Academic Research and is a collection of services provided specifically for researchers at the University of Birmingham. BEAR services are used by the researchers at Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH) for various types of neuroimaging data analysis.

BEAR services and basic resources, such the ones we will be using for the purpose of MRICN module, are freely available to the University of Birmingham research community. Extra resource which might be needed for some research projects can be purchased e.g., access to dedicated nodes and extra storage. This is something your PI/MSc/PhD project supervisor might be using and will give you access to.

BlueBEAR refers to the Linux High Performance Computing (HPC) environment which (1) enables researchers to run jobs simultaneously on many servers (thus providing fast and efficient processing capacity for data analysis), and (2) gives easy access to multiple apps, software libraries (e.g., software we will be using in this module to analyse MRI data), as well as various software development tools. As computing resources on BlueBEAR rely on Linux, in Workshop 1 you will learn some basic commands, which you will need to be familiar with to participate in MRICN brain imaging practical sessions and to complete module’s main assessment (data analysis assessment). More Linux commands and basic principle of scripting will be introduced in subsequent workshops.

There are two steps to gaining access to BlueBEAR:
- Being a member on an active BEAR project 
- Having a BEAR Linux account

!!! note "For students"
    Only a member of Academic staff e.g., your project supervisor or module lead can apply for a BEAR project. As a student you cannot apply for a BEAR project. If you are registered as a student on the MRICN module, you have been added as member to the project chechlmy-chbh-mricn. If not please contact your PI to provide you with access to BEAR project.

So, you are already a member of a BEAR project giving you BlueBEAR access, but you will still need to activate your BEAR Linux account via the self-service route or the service desk form. The information on how to do it and step-by-step instructions are available on a BEAR website, see the following [link](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/contact/bear-linux-account?_ga=2.176269477.1685318850.1729004469-1655917096.1696437021):

<b>Please follow these steps as above to make sure you have a BEAR Linux account before starting with workshop 1 materials.</b> To do that you will need to be on campus or using the University Remote Access Service (VPN). 

BEAR Portal provides web-based access to a range of BEAR services. Workshop 1 will provide step-by step guide to using BEAR Portal. <b>But before starting with Workshop 1, please follow instructions below to make sure you have access to BEAR Portal.</b>

## Checking access to BEAR Portal

- In a web browser navigate to https://portal.bear.bham.ac.uk to access BEAR Portal
- To log in please use your university username and password 
- First select the ‘University of Birmingham’ button as below and next log in via the University’s Single Sign-On page 

<b>Remember that the BEAR Portal is only available on campus or using the VPN!</b>
