# MRIonBEAR 

CHBH-edu/MRIonBEAR is a collection of educational resources created by members of the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH) to provide basic introduction to fundamentals in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data analysis, data analysis tools and computational resources available to the University of Birmingham research community.

## About these materials

This website contains workshop materials created for MSc module Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cognitive Neuroscience (MRICN) and its earlier version (Fundamentals in Brain Imaging) at the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. It is a ten-week course consisting of lectures and workshops introducing main techniques of functional and structural brain mapping using MRI with a strong emphasis on functional MRI (fMRI) but not limited to fMRI. Topics include the physics of MRI, and introduction to fMRI experimental design and to analysis of fMRI and other types of MRI data. This website includes only workshop materials aimed at very basic training in analysis of brain imaging data and data visualization. If you are a CHBH member and would like access to MRICN lecture recordings etc please contact one of the teaching staff members listed below.

## Aims and learning outcomes

### Aims
* To have a broad understanding of the use of MRI for mapping structural and functional brain organisation in cognitive neuroscience, both in theory and in practice.

### Learning outcomes
At the end of the course you will be able to:

* Demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts involved in MRI
* Show an understanding of how to design fMRI experiments
* Have the ability to work with BlueBEAR in a Linux environment and to use appropriate software to view and interpret MRI data
* Be able to analyse simple fMRI experiments and conduct basic tractography analysis

<b>Role: Course Lead</b>

[Magdalena Chechlacz](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/chechlacz-magda) is an Assistant Professor in Cognition and Ageing at the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. She initially trained and carried out a doctorate in cellular and molecular biology (2002). After working as a biologist (Larry L. Hillblom Foundation Fellowship at the University of California, San Diego) she decided on a career change to a more human-oriented science and neuroimaging. In order to gain formal training in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, she completed a second doctorate in psychology at the University of Birmingham under the supervision of Glyn Humphreys (2012). From 2013 to 2016, she held a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship and EPA Cephalosporin Junior Research Fellowship, Linacre College at the University of Oxford. In 2016 Dr Chechlacz returned to the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham as a Bridge Fellow.
