[MRI on BEAR](https://github.com/chbh-opensource/mri-on-bear-edu) is a collection of educational resources created by members of the [Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-human-brain-health), University of Birmingham, to provide a basic introduction to fundamentals in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data analysis, using the computational resources available to the University of Birmingham research community.

## About this website

This website contains workshop materials created for the MSc module 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cognitive Neuroscience' (MRICN) and its earlier version (Fundamentals in Brain Imaging) at the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. It is a ten-week course consisting of lectures and workshops introducing the main techniques of functional and structural brain mapping using MRI with a strong emphasis on - but not limited to - functional MRI (fMRI). Topics include the physics of MRI, experimental design for neuroimaging experiments and the analysis of fMRI and other types of MRI data. This website includes only the workshop materials, which provide a basic training in analysis of brain imaging data and data visualization. 

!!! success "Learning objectives"
    At the end of the course you will be able to:

    - Demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts involved in MRI
    - Show an understanding of how to design fMRI experiments
    - Have the ability to work with BlueBEAR in a Linux environment and to use appropriate software to view and interpret MRI data
    - Be able to analyse simple fMRI experiments and conduct basic tractography analysis

!!! danger "For externals not on the course"
    Whilst we have made these resources publicly available for anyone to use, please BEAR in mind that the course has been specifically designed to run on the computing resources at the University of Birmingham.

<h3>Dr Magdalena Chechlacz</h3>
<b>Role: Course Lead</b>

[Magdalena Chechlacz](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/chechlacz-magda) is an Assistant Professor in Cognition and Ageing at the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. She initially trained and carried out a doctorate in cellular and molecular biology (2002). After working as a biologist (Larry L. Hillblom Foundation Fellowship at the University of California, San Diego) she decided on a career change to a more human-oriented science and neuroimaging. In order to gain formal training in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, she completed a second doctorate in psychology at the University of Birmingham under the supervision of Glyn Humphreys (2012). From 2013 to 2016, she held a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship and EPA Cephalosporin Junior Research Fellowship, Linacre College at the University of Oxford. In 2016, Dr Chechlacz returned to the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham as a Bridge Fellow.
